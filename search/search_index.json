The current phase is the variable <code>damage_index</code> where:</p> <ul> <li>0: Normal</li> <li>1: Charged</li> <li>2: Super Charged</li> </ul> <p>The ball gains charge as it is hit by cars. When a car exerts a force on the ball, the ball charges up equal to the magnitude of the force (energy). The ball enters the next phase when it reaches a certain threshold:</p> <ul> <li>Charged: 2500 energy</li> <li>Super Charged: 11000 energy</li> </ul> <p>The current amount of energy (force absorded) is the <code>absorbed_force</code> variable.</p> <p>However, a hit does not always charge the ball. To make the ball charge up, the impact must be at least 500 energy, otherwise the ball will not charge at all. Furthermore, when the ball gets hit, it will temporarily accept less energy. The variable <code>force_accum_recent</code> stores the accumulated absorbed force (energy), but no more than 2500 energy. It decays over time at a rate of 2500 energy per second, and the ball will at most absorb <code>2500 - force_accum_recent</code> energy on a hit. Combined, this prevents players from charging the ball too quickly, limited to 2500 energy every second.</p> <p>Example: if you hit the ball with an impact of 2000 uu/s at t=0, and you hit the ball again with a force of 2000 uu/s at t=0.5, the <code>force_accum_recent</code> has decayed by 1250 and will be 750 when you hit the ball the second time, and therefore the ball will not accept more than 1750 energy, which means 250 energy gets lost.</p> <p>The ball's charge is reset, whenever it damages a floor tile owned by the opponent of whoever last touched the ball. To make damage the ball must hit the tile with a velocity of 250 uu/s or more perpendicular to the surface of contact. The side of a tile can only be hit if there's an open tile next to it, so usually the ball will hit the top of the tiles, and in those cases only the Z velocity matters, and must be 250 uu/s or more to make damage. There is also must have passed 0.2 seconds since the last time the ball damaged a tile.</p> <p>You can tell which team last hit the ball by checking the <code>packet.game_ball.latest_touch</code> object.

Once you feel confident, check out the dedicated #machine-learning channel in the RLBot discord for helpful resources!</p> <p>Q: What can I use ML for in Rocket League?</p> <p>A: Lots of things! Optimizing mechanics (wave-dashing, aerials, power-sliding, etc), analyzing replays (predicting shot percentages, car positions, etc), and even playing the game.</p> <p>Q: How could I use the replays available at calculated.gg?</p> <p>A: Tools like Training Data Extractor and carball exist to format replay data into an RLBot tick packet, and approximate player inputs between frames. These enable users to easily handle data available in replays for whatever purpose they might have.</p> <p>Q: Is it possible to get controls from replays so I can train a model to copy humans?:</p> <p>A: Training controls directly from replays has not been very successful.</p> <p>The reason for this may be that not all conditions the bot will encounter are present in replays, leading to a model being unable to handle certain conditions that were not present in the replays it was trained with.</p> <p>The most successful attempt is documented here.</p> <p>Q: Can I make a clone of Rocket League for training and then transfer it to the real game?</p> <p>A: It would be quite the project to clone Rocket League, but there is no reason that would not work with a little elbow grease!</p> <p>The user @Roboserg#9216 has been working on a Rocket League clone for some time, and has made very promising progress. His work is open source, and can be found here.</p> <p>Q: Can I use Supervised Learning to train a bot that mimics other bots?</p> <p>A: Yes you can! The ML bots Levi and Tensorbot were trained this way.</p> <p>Q: Can I use Reinforcement Learning to make a bot?</p> <p>A: This is the holy grail for many ML enthusiasts in the RLBot community.</p> <p>With the recent release of the Python library and Bakkesmod plugin RLGym, Reinforcement Learning can now be used to train models directly in the game. Some promising results have already been achieved, like Rhobot and Element. These models take quite a lot of compute power and time to train, but they are achievable with consumer-grade hardware. The largest RLGym project is currently a distributed learning bot Necto/Nexto.</p> <p>Reinforcement Learning can also be used to train specific mechanics, like Eagle and ElementAerial</p> <p>Q: Can I use this or that method to speed up Reinforcement Learning?</p> <p>A: You can just try it out, if it works for other problems, then it might also work for Rocket League.

It was made in 2018 when RLBot was still using DLL injection. Later, in 2019, the collaboration with Psyonix and the official API were introduced. Since then, there have only been minor changes and new features, which proves how well-designed v4 was. In fact, v5 is not that different from v4. It is primarily a rewrite and an opportunity fix the flaws of v4 that have been revealed over the years. So here are the main reasons we made v5:</p> <ul> <li>The closed-source part of v4 is doing more than just communication with the Psyonix API.   This has long prevented the community from fixing certain bugs themselves.   Therefore we are extracting that functionality into the open-source part of RLBot, making the closed-source part exclusively about communication with the API.</li> <li>The closed-source part of v4 is written in C++.   By rewritting the backend of RLBot in C# we hope that more people feel comfortable contributing to it.</li> <li>No more DLLs. You may not be aware, but most bots still uses a DLL to communicate directly to the RLBot backend.   In v5, the transition to web sockets is finally complete and this allows the bot inferfaces to be improved (e.g. Python type hints are not a hack anymore).</li> <li>All languages can start matches in v4, but the logic for launching of Rocket League and bots was only implemented in Python (and partially Rust).   This discouraged people from writing match starters (GUI, autoleague, etc) in other languages than Python (even CleoPetra written in Java uses a Python process to start matches).   Therefore we are moving this logic to the backend for v5 such that more languages can benefit from it.</li> <li>We are releasing ourselves from design choices made under restrictions of the DLL injection.</li> <li>The Psyonix API made a few extra features available to us, but we never integrated them in v4. They are integerated in v5.</li> <li>Python is very slow. The rewrite in C# has made this clear.</li> <li>The <code>.cfg</code> file format has no standard. We are changing to the similar <code>.toml</code> format.</li> </ul> <p>So while the changes to the functionality and interface are minor, the architecture and the framework's internal code is very different. We hope these changes will make it enjoyable to work with and contribute to RLBot moving forward.</p>"},{"location":"v5/framework/v5/#features-of-v5","title":"Features of v5","text":"<p>[Legend: \u2705=done, \ud83d\udfe8=todo, \u2728=new, \ud83d\udee0=reworked/changed, \u26d4=removed]</p> <ul> <li>\u2705\ud83d\udee0 First-class Windows &amp; Linux support<ul> <li>No current plans for MacOS, as there's no way to run Rocket League without a full VM</li> </ul> </li> <li>\u2705\ud83d\udee0 All bots connect to core directly via the sockets flatbuffer spec<ul> <li>As a consequence, adding new language support is much easier - if your language can write/read a TCP socket, it's possible!
